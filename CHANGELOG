March 21, 2011 - Release 0.2.4
    * GWASGeneViewer (bugfix): if the bonferroniThreshold was higher than the max_value, the bonferroniThreshold, 
                               wouldn't be displayed. The max_value of the scatterplot will be displayed to the higher
                               value (bonferroniThreshold or max_value).

March 14, 2011 - Release 0.2.3
    * Dygraph (lib): upgraded to new dygraph version (includes upstream changes and new functions in canvas object).
    * GWASGeneViewer (feature): support for drawing bonferroniThreshold added (can be set in draw method).

March 4, 2011 - Release 0.2.2
    * Dygraph (lib): upgraded to new dygraph version.
    * GeneViewer (lib): geneViewer library upgraded to 0.2.2
    * GWASGeneViewer (feature): methods to support new view-region functionality in GeneViewer library added.
    * GWASGeneViewer (feature): it is possible to select a specific SNP, which will be highlighted with a vertical 
                                line in the scatterplot (dygraph)
    * GWASGeneViewer (bugfix): If initial viewRegion is small enough, geneviewer will be displayed.
